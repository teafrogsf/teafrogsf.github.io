Hi there. I am a rising senior undergraduate student at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/). Currently, I am a research intern in [Prof. Xiaotie Deng](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/xiaotiedeng/index.htm)'s [daGAME Lab](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/research/researchlabs/237314.htm) at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), advised by [Dr. Zhaohua Chen](https://daleczh.github.io/). I am fortunate to join [The ShanghaiTech Multi-Agent systems Research Team (SMART)](http://dengji-zhao.net/smart/index.html) at ShanghaiTech University, advised by [Prof. Dengji Zhao](http://dengji-zhao.net/). I was a visiting student at [University of Wisconsin - Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/).

My current research interest is Algorithmic Game Theory (AGT), particularly **Mechanism Design on Social Networks** and **Mechanism Design on Ad Auctions**. In addition to making breakthroughs in theory, I am also interested in how mechanism can help people in practical ways. 

I am not a traditional CS student. I am interested in idealism, particularly ideological criticism. **I love teaching** and have been involved in the design of several courses as a TA. Now I am committed to promoting curriculum reform in my university. I am also interested in composing and mixing music with AI.

**I am looking for a Ph.D position in Fall 2024 or Fall 2025.**

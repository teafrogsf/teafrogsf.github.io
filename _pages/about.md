<!-- Hi there. I am a senior undergraduate student at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/). I am fortunate to join [The ShanghaiTech Multi-Agent systems Research Team (SMART)](http://dengji-zhao.net/smart/index.html) at ShanghaiTech University, advised by [Prof. Dengji Zhao](http://dengji-zhao.net/). I am now a research intern in [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.msra.cn/). I was a research intern in [Prof. Xiaotie Deng](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/xiaotiedeng/index.htm)'s [daGAME Lab](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/research/researchlabs/237314.htm) at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), advised by [Dr. Zhaohua Chen](https://daleczh.github.io/). I was also a visiting student at [University of Wisconsin - Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). -->

Hi there. My research interest is about *CONNECTION*. I am studying **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Multi-Agent System (MAS)**. 

**My current research interest:**

1. Are LLM-based multi-agent systems sufficiently **secure and efficient**? How can we design valuable mechanisms to ensure this (both theoretically and empirically)?  
2. How can LLMs truly engage in meaningful role-playing or writing? These two are similar in that they both reflect the linguistic state of **a real, specific human**.  
3. How can we examine or reflect on LLMs (and multi-agent systems) from **an anthropological perspective**?

<!-- 1. LLM组成的多智能体系统足够安全和有效率吗？如何设计有价值的机制来保证这一点？
2. LLM到底如何进行真正有价值的角色扮演/写作？这两者有相似之处，因为它们能够体现一个真实的具体的人类在语言上的状态。
3. 如何从人类学的角度考量或反思LLM（以及LLM组成的多智能体系统）？ -->

**If you are also interested in these directions and would like to collaborate with me, please contact me immediately!**


I am intrigued about how to design incentive compatible mechanisms on graphs (especially social networks), which mainly falls within the field of **Algorithmic Game Theory (AGT)**. My current work revolves around exploring the intersection of LLMs and AGT, with an emphasis on mechanism design for multi-agent systems.

I also works on **how multi-agent systems connect with human society**. I am exploring the evolution of competition and cooperation in LLM-based multi-agent systems (with or without human-computer interactions), which closely ties to game theory. At the same time, I am deeply interested in aligning large-scale multi-agent systems with human society. This includes, but is not limited to, the intersection of *sociology, anthropology, economics, psychology, philosophy, and LLMs*. I believe it is crucial to study whether language models can genuinely take on roles within a real social context.

Previously I worked on how to capture the relationships between different variables using deep learning methods. I was mainly focusing on **Electroencephalogram (EEG)** and **Graph Neural Networks (GNN)**. I am also interested in the use of graph neural networks for the analysis of multi-variable time series data, chemical molecules, social networks and so on.

**I love teaching** and have been involved in the design of several courses as a TA. Now I am committed to promoting curriculum reform in my university. I am also interested in composing and mixing music (with AI).

**I am looking for a Ph.D position in Fall 2025.**

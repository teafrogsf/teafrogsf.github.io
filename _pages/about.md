<!-- Hi there. I am a senior undergraduate student at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/).

**I am actively looking for a Ph.D./RA position in Fall 2025.**

Hi there. My research interest is about *CONNECTION*. I am studying **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Multi-Agent System (MAS)**. 

**My current research interest:**

1. Are **LLM-based multi-agent systems** sufficiently **secure and efficient**? How can we design valuable mechanisms to ensure this (both theoretically and empirically)?  
2. How can we **attack the reasoning process** of LLMs? How can we **prove the inherent flaws** (if they exist) in reasoning models? How can we distinguish **different error modes** in various LLMs? Furthermore, can competitive-level problems (including Olympiad Informatics problems) contribute to these studies?
3. How can LLMs truly engage in meaningful **role-playing or writing**? These two tasks are similar in that they both reflect the linguistic state of **a real, specific human**.  
4. How can we examine or reflect on LLMs (and multi-agent systems) from **an anthropological perspective**? Can we **construct a culture** for multi-agent systems? Furthermore, how can we **evaluate the real value** of highly metric-driven multi-agent systems for humans?
5. **How do language models model language**? Can we understand the representation of *(even multimodal)* linguistic concepts in language models through **probing models**? Can modern and contemporary **philosophy of language** (continental or analytic) help reshape our understanding of these questions?

<!-- 1. LLM组成的多智能体系统足够安全和有效率吗？如何设计有价值的机制来保证这一点？
2. 如何攻击LLMs的推理过程？如何证明reasoning model中存在的固定缺陷？如何区分不同LLMs的错误模式？此外，competitive-level problems (including Olympiad Informatics problems)能否在这些研究中有所帮助？
3. LLM到底如何进行真正有价值的角色扮演/写作？这两者有相似之处，因为它们能够体现一个真实的具体的人类在语言上的状态。
4. 如何从人类学的角度考量或反思LLM（以及LLM组成的多智能体系统）？我们是否能构建多智能体系统的“文化”？此外，我们如何评估高度指标化的多智能体系统对人类的真实价值？
5. 语言模型如何建模语言？如何理解语言的概念在语言模型中的体现？能否通过probing model理解（甚至是多模态的）语言的概念在语言模型中的体现？近现代的语言哲学能否对重塑我们的理解有所帮助？ -->

I works on **how multi-agent systems connect with human society**. I am exploring the evolution of competition and cooperation in LLM-based multi-agent systems (with or without human-computer interactions), which closely ties to game theory. At the same time, I am deeply interested in aligning large-scale multi-agent systems with human society. This includes, but is not limited to, the intersection of *sociology, anthropology, economics, psychology, philosophy, and LLMs*. I believe it is crucial to study whether language models can genuinely take on roles within a real social context.

I am also intrigued about how to design (incentive-compatible) mechanisms on graphs or multi-agent systems, which mainly falls within the field of **Algorithmic Game Theory (AGT)**. My current work revolves around exploring the intersection of LLMs and AGT, with an emphasis on mechanism design for multi-agent systems.

Previously I worked on how to capture the relationships between different variables using deep learning methods. I was mainly focusing on **Electroencephalogram (EEG)** and **Graph Neural Networks (GNN)**. I am also interested in the use of graph neural networks for the analysis of multi-variable time series data, chemical molecules, social networks and so on.

**I love teaching** and have been involved in the design of several courses as a TA. Now I am committed to promoting curriculum reform in my university. I am also interested in composing and mixing music (with AI).

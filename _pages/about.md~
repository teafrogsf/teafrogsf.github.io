Hi there. I am a visiting student at [University of Wisconsin - Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). I am a junior student at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/). My current research interest is Algorithm Game Theory (AGT), particularly **Mechanism Design on Social Network**. In addition to making breakthroughs in theory, I am also interested in how mechanism can help people in practical ways.

I am not a traditional CS student. I am interested in idealism, particularly ideological criticism. I love teaching and have been involved in the design of several courses as a TA. Now I am committed to promoting curriculum reform in my university. I am also interested in composing and mixing music with AI.

<!--Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.-->

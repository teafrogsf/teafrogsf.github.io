  contents: I have been working as a teaching assistant since the first semester of my sophomore year. I have a great passion for teaching and I helped 1/4 students in my university to learn how to get started in information science. However, there is still much room for improvement in both my teaching style and the courses I have taught. I will continue to work on this.
